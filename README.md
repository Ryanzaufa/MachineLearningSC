# MachineLearningSC
Repository for Machine Learning assignments from Startup Campus.
In this repository i have 3 file ipynb from Google Colab about my Machine Learning and Deep Learning assignments

# 01
In the first file I learned about the basics in Machine Learning, from importing libraries, input datasets, Preprocessing and Train-Test Split.

# 02
In the second file, I use the clustering method, perform data segmentation with clustering method, evaluation with silhouette score to determine the best number of clusters and visualization of cluster results.

# 03
And in the third file, I created an ANN model using Pytorch and MNIST datasets. I also create hyperparameters, layers, loss functions, optimizers and determine the accuracy as well as the confusion matrix.
